## üìù Description

This repository contains the Unity project for a 2D game, developed as part of the **Game Engineering course at the University of Regensburg**. It‚Äôs a collaborative effort with guidelines for setup, contributions, and special considerations when working with Unity and Git.

üëâ **Please read this README before collaborating.**

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

| Requirement | Version / Link                                                                                              |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Unity       | [2022.3.53f1](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) _(Any 2022.3.\* should work)_                         |
| Git         | [Latest version](https://git-scm.com/downloads)                                                             |

---

### üõ†Ô∏è Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/realdegrees/ur-game-engineering.git
   ```

   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:realdegrees/ur-game-engineering.git
   ```

   [Follow these instructions for GitHub Desktop.](https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/adding-and-cloning-repositories/cloning-a-repository-from-github-to-github-desktop)

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**

   ```bash
   cd ur-game-engineering
   ```

3. **Open the Project in Unity**

   - Open Unity Hub.
   - Click **"Add" -> "Add project from disk"** and select the project directory.
   - Open the project.

4. **Start a Feature Branch**
   Refer to the [Branching Strategy](#-branching-strategy) section to create a new branch.

### üõ†Ô∏è Sample Scenes

To help you get started quickly, the project includes sample scenes that demonstrate various features. These scenes can be found in the following directory:

**`Assets/Scenes/Samples`**

| Scene        | Description                                          |
| ------------ | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Input**    | Examples of player input handling and key bindings.  |
| **Camera**   | Demonstrates camera movement and transitions.        |
| **Movement** | Showcases player movement mechanics.                 |
| **Tilemaps** | Includes examples of creating and managing tilemaps. |

Open these scenes in Unity to explore their functionality and use them as a reference for your development.

---

### Ignore Playground Scenes

- Name personal test scenes with `-dev` (e.g., `lighting-scene-dev.unity`) to exclude them via `.gitignore`.
- Use these scenes to prototype and test before applying your changes to game scenes.

## üå≤ Branching Strategy

| Strategy           | Description                                                               |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Protected Branches | Direct pushes to `develop` and `main` are restricted.                     |
| Feature Branches   | Work on new features/fixes in a branch created from `develop`.            |
| Pull Requests      | Merge your feature branch into `develop` via a Pull Request after review. |

### Creating a Feature Branch

```bash
git checkout develop
```

```bash
git pull
```

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### üîé Review Process

- Describe your changes briefly in the PR so others can understand your changes.
- PRs _should_ be reviewed by **at least 1 team member**.
- Address feedback before requesting a merge.

## üõ†Ô∏è Working with Unity and Git

Unity projects require specific version control practices.

### Scene Management

| Tip                   | Explanation                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Merging Scenes**    | Scene files (`.unity`) are hard to merge. Avoid simultaneous edits. |
| **Rebasing**          | Frequently rebase your branch onto develop to avoid conflicts       |
| **Exclusive Editing** | Only one person should work on a scene at a time.                   |

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Handling Scene Conflicts

- **Do not attempt to merge scene files.**

  - If a conflict occurs, coordinate with the team to resolve it.
  - Overwrite one version and reapply the other‚Äôs changes later.

- **Regularly pull changes** to avoid conflicts.

  ```bash
  git pull origin develop
  ```

## ü§ù Contribution Guidelines

### Commit Messages

Use clear, descriptive commit messages.  
**Examples**:

- feat: adds double jump
- fix: adjusts player speed to 30
- refactor: reorganizes player input system

### Commit Types

| Type       | Description                                               |

| `docs`     | Documentation changes.                                    |
| `style`    | Code style changes (no functional changes).               |
| `refactor` | Code restructuring.                                       |

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Git Clone or Pull Failed

If you encounter authentication issues, use the GitHub CLI:

- [Install GitHub CLI](https://cli.github.com/)

### .NET SDK Missing

Errors about the .NET SDK may occur, especially in VSCode. Install the required SDK:

- [Download .NET SDK 8.0](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
