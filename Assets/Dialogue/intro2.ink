Hello, little lad. Are you hurt? #speaker:Player #portrait:player
Papa... where are you, Papa... #speaker:Child #portrait:child
I've got to help him... He's weak and defenceless, and he's got nothing to do with this war. #speaker:Player #portrait:player
Nobody's left here, everyone has been killed. I can't leave him here, he's so small... he won't survive if I don't take him with me. #speaker:Player #portrait:player
It's okay, I'm not going to hurt you. I'll keep you safe. What's your name? #speaker:Player #portrait:player
... #speaker:Child #portrait:child
He's too traumatized to respond. I'll get him away from here now and ask questions later. #speaker:Player #portrait:player
    -> END
